OOP
===

A repository of code to help understand OOP.

This repository currently contains a simple tic-tac-toe game. The game is missing a single piece before it is complete, the detection of a win state of the grid. (For everyone to figure out for themselves, will also do at the .hack meet)

The tic-tac-toe game does NOT use inheritance(explicitly) , interfaces, abstract classes or any of that fancy stuff. It is simply made of classes (components) that make a whole by being used in a certain way. 

Do not quote me, but I think the tic tac toe game would maybe be a solid 4 mark for the Java semester work. :)
