tic tac toe
===========

The game is missing a single piece before it is complete, the detection of a win state of the grid. (For everyone to figure out for themselves, will also do at the .hack meet)

The tic-tac-toe game does NOT use inheritance(explicitly) , interfaces, abstract classes or any of that fancy stuff. It is simply made of classes (components) that make a whole by being used in a certain way. 

Do not quote me, but IMHO the tic tac toe game would maybe be 20/30 - 25/30 for the Java semester work. :)

jtodo
=====

My (Kristo) personal java semester work from last year. Oh boy... . This homework was graded 30/30 (by Mart Mangus) after 20 seconds. Although looking at it now is painfull. There are places that are marked ToDo and that is fine, but I will maybe speak about what is wrong in some places at the next .hack meet.
